# Main Goals For This Website

My main goal was to have the user be able to exchange between currencies of their choosing. I wanted the box with the conversions to be in the center of the screen. I also wanted to have the user access it on their phone/tablets. I was successful on implementing these goals and I feel very proud in achieving these goals. However, I was able to implement something that was not a part of my main goals

# Stretch Goals For This Website
My original idea was to implement a different tab where a user is able to answer some trivia question to the best of their ability and their scores would be saved on the website for them to see. I was unable to do that due to time constraints, however, I plan to implement it in the near future. My current stretch goal is to implement a "switch" button that will switch the contents of the converting such as: the flag, the dropdown menus, and the values in the boxes. It has been fully completed and I was able to do that without too much difficulty.

# Difficulties
Throughout the making of this website, I experienced multiple struggles along the way. The main struggle that I had was trying to style the main box with all of the elements inside it. When starting this website, I was pretty weak in CSS and I didn't fully understand how to style the website in the way that I wanted to. Now I have a stronger understanding of CSS and I enjoyed making this website the way that it is currently. Another struggle that I had was trying to make the number the user puts in convert with the currency that the user chooses in the second dropdown menu. It did not take too long to figure out how to implement it, but it took a good chunk of the process in making this website.


# Directions

1. First, choose a currency from the first dropdown menu where it says "Select 1st Currency". (You might need to search up the currency code of the specific one you're looking for)
2. Then, choose a currency from the second dropdown menu where it says "Select 2nd Currency".
3. Next, put in the specific amount you want to convert in the first box.
4. Then, press the green "Calculate" button to convert the currency and it will show up in the second box.
5. If you ever need to switch the currencies, press the "switch" button to switch every element.

And there you go! You are able to use this website without having any difficulty understanding how it works. I hope it's worth your stay!
