# FlipMoney

This Website has the help of Exchange Rate API to be able to exchange the values that are listed in the API. There are over 150 different currencies in the API, however, in order to find the currency you would want to choose, a flag of the country or organization it comes from will appear next to the dropdown menus.

This is the link to the API:

# Main Goals For This Website

My main goal was to have the user be able to exchange between currencies of their choosing. I wanted the box with the conversions to be in the center of the screen. I also wanted to have the user access it on their phone/tablets. I was successful on implementing these goals and I feel very proud in achieving these goals. However, I was able to implement something that was not a part of my main goals

# Stretch Goals For This Website
My original idea was to implement a different tab where a user is able to answer some trivia question to the best of their ability and their scores would be saved on the website for them to see. I was unable to do that due to time constraints, however, I plan to implement it in the near future. My current stretch goal is to implement a "flip" button that will flip the contents of the converting such as: the flag, the dropdown menus, and the values in the boxes. It has been fully completed and I was able to do that without too much difficulty.
